## Mercedes-Benz Mobile SDK
The Mercedes-Benz Mobile SDK (Software Development Kit) encapsulates customer and car data and vehicle functions needed to develop mobile apps for Mercedes Benz cars, which are enabled for Mercedes me services.
In addition, the SDK provides basic functions like registration, password-less login, vehicle assignment and service activation for all SDK app developers and thus helps them to concentrate on the main purpose and business value of the app.
The underlying architecture is reliable and includes worldwide scalable components for building your own Mercedes-Benz Mobile app.
